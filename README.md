![Searchable Snapshots](images/00-talk.png "Searchable Snapshots")

## Setup

The setup will check that Elasticsearch and Kibana are running.

It will also add Kibana Canvas slides.

### Run on cloud (recommended)

This specific configuration is used to run the demo on a [cloud instance](https://cloud.elastic.co).
You need to create a `.cloud` local file which contains:

```
CLOUD_ID=the_cloud_id_you_can_read_from_cloud_console
CLOUD_PASSWORD=the_generated_elastic_password
```

Run:

```sh
./setup.sh
```

### Run Locally (NOT SUPPORTED FOR THIS DEMO)

Run Elastic Stack:

```sh
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up
```

And run:

```sh
./setup.sh
```
